## User Story
```
As a health-conscious person
 - I WANT to get the latest information on Covid-19, including nearby testing centers, state and national-statistics, relevant news articles, and CDC guidance
 - SO THAT I can be well-informed and ensure I’m adhering to expert-recommendations.

GIVEN a landing page with a form input field
 - WHEN I enter a city and state
 - THEN I am taken to a page featuring a map-view, a list of nearby testing centers and a new search field
 - WHEN I hover over a marker displayed on the map
 - THEN I am presented with that specific marker's facility name and address
 - WHEN I click on a location on the list display to the right of the map
 - THEN I am presented with specific information about that location, including address, phone number, a link for directions and hours of operation
 - WHEN I enter a new city and state in the search field, then I am presented with new data relevant to that specific location
 - WHEN I scroll down the page
 - THEN I am presented with a list of the latest COVID-related news articles, state and national statistics featuring case count, deaths and recoveries, and a list of CDC recommendations
 - WHEN I click on the headline of a news article
 - THEN I am directed to that article’s webpage where I can read the article in its entirety
 - WHEN I click on a state in the national statistics map
 - THEN I am taken to that state's Department of Health website
 - WHEN I click the Home link in either the footer or top navigation menu
 - THEN I am taken back to the application's landing page where I can re-enter another city and state to produce new, relevant data
